This is a sample to use for making manual verdicts.

To use it, open it and complete column D (which is the Threshold) for each site within each sheet. each sheet represents a channel except for sheet number 17.

If you had any comments, put them under column F


** DO not forget to update the sheet 17: 
1) update the muscle acronym using the lookup table on column J and K. make sure you note the channel number under column A.

2) Also Update the Case number under F1



Always make a copy of the sample verdict first and make sure you rename it properly and keep the record of changes.
